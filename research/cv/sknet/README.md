# [SK-Net Description](#contents)

## Description

  Selective Kernel Networks is inspired by cortical neurons that can dynamically adjust their own receptive field according to different stimuli. It is a product of combining SE operator, Merge-and-Run Mappings, and attention on inception block ideas. Carry out Selective Kernel transformation for all convolution kernels> 1 to make full use of the smaller theory brought by group/depthwise convolution, so that the design of adding multiple channels and dynamic selection will not bring a big overhead

  this is example of training SKNET50 with CIFAR-10 dataset in MindSpore. Training SKNet50 for just 90 epochs using 8 Ascend 910, we can reach top-1 accuracy of 94.49% on CIFAR10.

# [Features](#contents)

## Mixed Precision

The [mixed precision](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/programming_guide/en/master/enable_mixed_precision.html) training method accelerates the deep learning neural network training process by using both the single-precision and half-precision data types, and maintains the network precision achieved by the single-precision training at the same time. Mixed precision training can accelerate the computation process, reduce memory usage, and enable a larger model or batch size to be trained on specific hardware.
For FP16 operators, if the input data type is FP32, the backend of MindSpore will automatically handle it with reduced precision. Users could check the reduced-precision operators by enabling INFO log and then searching ‘reduce precision’.

## [Script Parameters](#contents)

Parameters for both training and evaluation can be set in config.py.

- Config for SKNET50, CIFAR10 dataset

```bash
"class_num": 10,                # dataset class number
"batch_size": 32,                 # batch size of input tensor

"weight_decay": 1e-4,             # weight decay
"epoch_size": 90,                 # only valid for taining, which is always 1 for inference
"pretrain_epoch_size": 0,         # epoch size that model has been trained before loading pretrained checkpoint, actual training epoch size is equal to epoch_size minus pretrain_epoch_size
"save_checkpoint": True,          # whether save checkpoint or not
"save_checkpoint_epochs": 5,      # the epoch interval between two checkpoints. By default, the last checkpoint will be saved after the last epoch
"keep_checkpoint_max": 10,        # only keep the last keep_checkpoint_max checkpoint

## [Training Process](#contents)

### Usage

#### Running on Ascend

```bash
# distributed training
Usage:
bash run_distribute_train.sh [DATASET_PATH] [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [DEVICE_NUM]

# standalone training
Usage:
export DEVICE_ID=0
bash run_standalone_train.sh [DATASET_PATH]
```

For distributed training, a hccl configuration file with JSON format needs to be created in advance.

Please follow the instructions in the link [hccn_tools](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/utils/hccl_tools).

Training result will be stored in the example path, whose folder name begins with "train" or "train_parallel". Under this, you can find checkpoint file together with result like the following in log.

### Result

- Training SKNET50 with CIFAR10 dataset

```bash
# distribute training result(8 pcs)
epoch: 90 step: 195, loss is 1.1160697e-05
epoch time: 35059.094 ms, per step time: 179.790 ms
```
