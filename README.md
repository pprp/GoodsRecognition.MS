## Welcome to the Model Zoo for MindSpore

In order to facilitate developers to enjoy the benefits of MindSpore framework, we will continue to add typical networks and some of the related pre-trained models. If you have needs for the model zoo, you can file an issue on [gitee](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/issues) or [MindSpore](https://bbs.huaweicloud.com/forum/forum-1076-1.html), We will consider it in time.

- SOTA models using the latest MindSpore APIs

- The  best benefits from MindSpore

- Officially maintained and supported

## Announcements

### 2021.9.15 Set up repository `models`

`models` comes from the directory `model_zoo` of repository [mindspore](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore). This new repository doesn't contain any history of commits about the directory `model_zoo` in `mindspore`, you could refer to the repository `mindspore` for the past commits.

## Related Website

Here is the ModelZoo for MindSpore which support different devices including Ascend, GPU, CPU and mobile.

If you are looking for exclusive models only for Ascend using different ML platform, you could refer to [Ascend ModelZoo](https://hiascend.com/software/modelzoo) and corresponding [gitee repository](https://gitee.com/ascend/modelzoo)

## FAQ

For more information about `MindSpore` framework, please refer to [FAQ](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/faq/en/master/index.html)

- **Q: How to resolve the lack of memory while using the model directly under "models" with errors such as *Failed to alloc memory pool memory*?**

  **A**: The typical reason for insufficient memory when directly using models under "models" is due to differences in operating mode (`PYNATIVE_MODE`), operating environment configuration, and license control (AI-TOKEN). `PYNATIVE_MODE` usually uses more memory than `GRAPH_MODE` , especially in the training graph that needs back propagation calculation, you can try to use some smaller batch size; the operating environment will also cause similar problems due to the different configurations of NPU cores, memory, etc.; different gears of License control (AI-TOKEN ) will cause different memory overhead during execution. You can also try to use some smaller batch sizes.

- **Q: How to resolve the error about the interface are not supported in some network operations, such as `cann not import`?**

  **A**: Please check the version of MindSpore and the branch you fetch the modelzoo scripts. Some model scripits in latest branch will use new interface in the latest version of MindSpore.
